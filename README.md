Inspired by classics like Cooking Mama and Dave the Diver, Maki Madness blends strategy, dexterity, and quick thinking into an addictive gaming experience with a simple setup using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Illustrator.

But the journey doesn't end here. Future updates promise even more excitement, with plans to introduce a main menu where players can access game rules, view high scores, and dive straight into the action. Plus, added challenges as dynamic interruptions disrupt your maki-making flow, forcing you to tackle unexpected chores before you can get back to the kitchen.

Are you ready to take on the culinary challenge? Grab your apron, sharpen your skills, and let the Maki Madness begin!
